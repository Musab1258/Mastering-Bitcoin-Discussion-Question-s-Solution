### Question 1: How does mining solve the Byzantine Generals Problem?

### Question 2: What happens to a transaction that isn't validated by your node?

### Question 3: What happens if a miner tries to pay itself a higher subsidy than allowed?

### Question 4: In 2016, there was ~3 EH/sec of processing power. Today there are 150 EH/sec. What is the right threshold for securing the network? Can you have too much security?

### Question 5: Under what circumstances would a node receive an orphan block? Why would it not be discarded if its parent hasn't been received? How long should a node wait? Do you see any problems with keeping it for a long time?

### Question 6: A 10-minute block interval was set by Satoshi. Is that too slow? How might we speed it up? What problems might be caused by a shorter interval?

### Question 7: How is work by a miner monitored by pools? Could this be gamed?

### Question 8: Bonus: How do p2pools work? Why is this not the main method used?

### Question 9: Bonus: What are the largest pools today and what risk do they pose?

### Question 10: What prevents miners from signaling that they will support an upgrade but later not enforce it?

### Question 11: Upgrades have become increasingly more difficult to get merged and accepted by the community. Should we make it easier? If so, how?
