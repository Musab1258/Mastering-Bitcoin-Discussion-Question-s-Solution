### Question 1: Why doesn't Bitcoin have a hierarchical network?

The Bitcoin network is a decentralized peer-to-peer network of nodes that validate Bitcoin transactions. All nodes are equal and independent of each other, which enhances the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin does not have a hierarchical structure because, in a hierarchical structure, the top has more authority than those at the bottom. A hierarchical structure leads to centralization and dependence which goes against the Bitcoin principle of decentralization.  

### Question 2: What is the difference between the Bitcoin network and Bitcoin as a currency?

The Bitcoin network is a decentralized network of peer-to-peer nodes that validate Bitcoin transactions and keep a record of the Bitcoin ledger. The nodes in a Bitcoin network validate transactions through a process called mining. Bitcoin as a currency is the digital currency used on the Bitcoin network. It can be transferred from one wallet to another and its transfer is irreversible. The Bitcoin currency's smallest unit is Satoshi, and 100 million Satoshi makes one Bitcoin, which means one Satoshi is 0.00000001 Bitcoin.

### Question 3: What is the double-spend problem and how did bitcoin solve it?

In physical currencies when you spend money, the money is transferred from you to the reciever and you no longer have possession of the money. But, in digital currencies there is no physical transfer of money, which leads to the double-spend problem, a situation where can spend the same money more than once. In traditional centralized systems, there is a clearing-house that checks, confirm, and record all transactions.

In decentralized system there is no cental authority to check, confrirm, and record all transactions. Bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism called proof of work to solve the double-spend problem. The proof of work mechanism is a mechanism in which nodes in the Bitcoin network try to solve a computation problem. After solving the problem they then agree on the state of transcations in the network and stores the validated transactions on the blockchain. The consensus mechanism helps the Bitcoin network track all bitcoin in circulation.

### Question 4: What determines the rate of inflation in bitcoin?

During mining, bitcoin transactions are validated an new bitcoins are issued to miners who contributed to the mining process. The issuance of the bitcoin currency is capped at 21 million bitcoins. In every four years the amount of Bitcoin issued is halved. In 2009 when Bitcoin was launched, the amount of bitcoins issued during mining was 50, then it halved to 25 2012, 12.5 in 2016, 6.25 in 2020. 

Halving ensures that the amount of bitcoins issued is decreased gradually till zero by the year 2140. With the decrease rate of bitcoin issuance, bitcoin becomes deflationary. Capping the total amount of bitcoin makes bitcoin deflationary.

### Question 5: Do you think it would be better if bitcoin transactions were reversible?

Transcation irreversibilty is a core Bitcoin principle that cannot be compromised. Bitcoin transaction irreversibility creates trust in in the network, which is essential. Transaction irreversibilty makes Bitcoin secure and immune to a lot of problems battling other digital currencies. So, I think it is best for bitcoin transactions to remain irreversible.

### Question 6: Do you believe that bitcoin needs to be competitive with visa/mastercard to succeed?

Bitcoin is a digital currency that offers security, censorship-resistance, and inflation protection to its users. Although Bitcoin does not need to be competitive with Visa/Mastercard to succeed, because it has a lot of use cases and benefits other than facilitating payments. But, in terms of payments and remittances, Bitcoin has to improve its transaction speed and scalability in order to compete effectively with traditional payment systems.
