### Question 1: What is the relationship between private keys, signatures, and witnesses?

### Question 2: The public key is represented by an address. Why do we need addresses and just not send bitcoin to public keys?

### Question 3: What is a one-way cryptographic function and how do we use it to derive public keys?

### Question 4: Bonus: What are some ways that private keys have been broken because of lack of entropy?

### Question 5: How do we know that the discrete log problem is hard to break?

### Question 6: Bitcoin uses the elliptic curve over a finite field of primer order. What does that mean using common English terms? Why is the order prime?

### Question 6: Why would we use Base58 for addresses rather than Base64? Would you make any modifications beyond Base58?

### Question 7: What is a checksum and how are they used in Bitcoin addresses?

### Question 8: Why is a compressed private key a misnomer?

### Question 9: What is the difference between P2PKH and P2SH?

### Question 10: What is the difference between a hot wallet and cold storage?
