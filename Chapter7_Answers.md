### Question 1: There is a bug in the CHECKMUTLISIG opcode. Why don't we just fix it?

### Question 2: P2SH shifts the burden of fees and complexity from the sender to the spender? Why would you want to do this?

### Question 3: Timelocks (nlocktime) are used to lock funds until a certain time or blockheight after which they are valid. Is it possible to invalidate transactions after a certain time or blockheight?

### Question 4: Provide a scenario that you'd personally use a multisig transaction for.
